# Advent of code 2023
This repo is a place for me to record my attempts at the Advent of Code 2023 coding challenges. 

Hopefully through this, I can learn more about using powershell (or other languages too?) as well as using git.

The challenge website can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/2023)https://adventofcode.com/2023).
