#Advent-of-Code-2023

Each day's folder will contain the day's input text file along with a separate folder for each part of the day.

When a previous part's script is reused, I will copy the previous part's script into the new part and comment individual lines (#) out that were
specific to the previous part. Regular comments will be formatted using <##>.

This probably isn't best practice but it looks nice to me and this is my repo dammit.
